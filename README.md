## The Clock

Based on 'The Clock and Compass: Master the Basics of Lighting' at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTiQ1bqcK3E

See [Clock and Zones](/Clock_and_Zones.png)

### The Camera is Always at Position of 6 O'Clock

Imagine the position on a clock at 6.

### The Subject is Always at the Center of the Clock

Imagine the position on a clock where the dials are attached at, the center.

### The 180 Degrees BEHIND the Subject is the Dark Zone

Imagine the area on a clock of 9 to 3.

### The 180 Degrees IN FRONT OF the Subject is the Hot Zone

Imagine the area on a clock of 3 to 9.

### The Position of the Key Light (the Main Light Source) is (Always) at Position of 4 or 8 O'Clock

Imagine the position on a clock at 4 (lighting from right) or 8 (lighting from left).

#### The Position of the Iris Highlight is (Always) at Position 2 or 10 O'Clock

See [Two O'Clock Position of Iris Highlight](/Two_O_Clock_Position_of_Iris_Highlight.png)

Imagine the position on a clock at 2 (lighting from right) or 10 (lighting from left).

***NOTE***: This position will cause the shadow from the Nose to reach the Lip Line, which is considered aesthetically pleasing.

See [Shadow from the Nose reaches the Lip Line](/Shadow_from_the_Nose_reaches_the_Lip_Line.png)

### The Position of the Rim Light (the Secondary Light Source) is (Always) at Position of 11 or 1 O'Clock

Imagine the position on a clock at 11 (lighting from right) or 1 (lighting from left).

The purpose of the Rim Light is to separate the Subject from the Background.

### The Position of the Fill Light (the Tertiary Light Source) is (Always) at Position of 8 or 4 O'Clock

Imagine the position on a clock at 8 (lighting from right) or 4 (lighting from left).

The purpose of the Fill Light is to compensate for (too deep) Shadows on the Subject.
